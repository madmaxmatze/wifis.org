By setting up your own wifis.org url (like <a href=\"\/example\">www.wifis.org\/example<\/a>), you’ll give anyone in your Wi-Fi range the opportunity to contact you without them knowing who you are and where you live.

Be part of the community. <a href=\"\/p\/login\">Join us.<\/a> <\/p> <\/div> <h3>What does it cost me?<\/h3> <div class=\"indent\"> <p>Absolutely nothing. wifis.org is and will always be a free service.<\/p> <\/div> <h3>How do I set up an account and register my own url?<\/h3> <div class=\"indent\"> <p>Follow these steps:<\/p> <ol> <li><a href=\"\/p\/login\">Log in<\/a> with your Google or Facebook account.<\/li> <li>Choose your wifis.org url.<\/li> <li>Go to the settings of your wireless router or modem.<\/li> <li>Change your wifi network’s name to your wifis.org url.
